## 📊 Performance Analysis

### 🔍 Overview
This analysis evaluates the **yearly performance of products** by:
- Comparing each product’s sales to its **average performance**.
- Assessing the **year-over-year (YoY) growth**.

### 📌 SQL Query

```sql
WITH yearly_product_sales AS (
SELECT
YEAR(f.order_date) AS order_year,
p.product_name,
SUM(f.sales_amount) AS current_sales
FROM [gold.fact_sales] f
LEFT JOIN [gold.dim_products] p
ON f.product_key = p.product_key
WHERE f.order_date IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY YEAR(f.order_date), p.product_name
)

SELECT
order_year,
product_name,
current_sales,
AVG(current_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY product_name) avg_sales,
current_sales - AVG(current_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY product_name) AS diff_avg,
CASE WHEN current_sales - AVG(current_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY product_name) > 0 THEN 'Above Avg'
     WHEN current_sales - AVG(current_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY product_name) < 0 THEN 'Below Avg'
     ELSE 'Avg'
END avg_change,
LAG(current_sales) OVER(PARTITION BY product_name ORDER BY order_year) AS py_sales,
current_sales - LAG(current_sales) OVER(PARTITION BY product_name ORDER BY order_year) AS diff_py,
CASE WHEN current_sales - LAG(current_sales) OVER(PARTITION BY product_name ORDER BY order_year) > 0 THEN 'Increase'
     WHEN current_sales - LAG(current_sales) OVER(PARTITION BY product_name ORDER BY order_year) < 0 THEN 'Decrease'
     ELSE 'No Change'
END py_change
FROM yearly_product_sales
ORDER BY product_name, order_year;
```
📌 Insights:
Products with Above Avg sales perform better than their historical average.
Year-over-Year changes (Increase/Decrease) help track product demand trends.

## 📊 Part-To-Whole Analysis

### 🔍 Overview
This analysis identifies **which product categories contribute the most to overall sales**.  
By calculating the **percentage share of each category**, businesses can focus on the most profitable ones.

### 📌 SQL Query
```sql
WITH category_sales AS (
SELECT 
category,
SUM(sales_amount) AS Total_sales
FROM [gold.fact_sales] f
LEFT JOIN [gold.dim_products] p
ON p.product_key = f.product_key
GROUP BY category)

SELECT 
category,
Total_sales,
SUM(Total_sales) OVER () overall_sales,
CONCAT(ROUND((CAST(Total_sales AS FLOAT) / SUM(Total_sales) OVER ()) * 100, 2),'%') AS percentage_of_total
FROM category_sales
ORDER BY Total_sales DESC;
```
📌 Insights:
Electronics contributes the highest (33.33%) to overall sales.
Furniture & Clothing together account for nearly 50% of total sales.
Lower-performing categories (e.g., Accessories, Others) may require marketing boosts. ** Need to fix it **

## 🔍 Data Segmentation

### 📊 Overview
This analysis segments products into different **cost ranges** and counts how many products fall into each segment.  
Understanding product distribution by price helps in **pricing strategy, inventory management, and sales forecasting**.

### 📌 SQL Query

```sql
WITH Product_segments AS (
SELECT 
product_key,
product_name,
cost,
CASE WHEN cost< 100 THEN 'Below 100'
	 WHEN cost BETWEEN 100 AND 500 THEN '100-500'
	 WHEN cost BETWEEN 500 AND 1000 THEN '500-1000'
	 ELSE 'Above 1000'
END cost_range
FROM [gold.dim_products])

SELECT 
cost_range,
COUNT(product_key) AS total_products
FROM Product_segments
GROUP BY cost_range
ORDER BY total_products DESC
```
📌 Key Insights
Most products (110) fall in the "Below 100" range, indicating a high volume of low-cost items.
Products priced between 100-500 are the second most common (101), suggesting mid-range pricing is also popular.
High-cost products (Above 1000) are the least common (39), which could indicate either a niche market or a strategic focus on affordability.

## 🔍 Customer Segmentation

### 📊 Overview
This analysis groups customers into three segments based on their **spending behavior and lifespan**:
- **VIP:** Customers with at least 12 months of history and spending **more than €5,000**.
- **Regular:** Customers with at least 12 months of history but spending **€5,000 or less**.
- **New:** Customers with a lifespan of **less than 12 months**.
```sql
WITH customer_spending AS (
SELECT
c.customer_key,
SUM(f.sales_amount) AS total_spending,
MIN(order_date) AS first_order,
MAX(order_date) AS last_order,
DATEDIFF(MONTH,MIN(order_date),MAX(order_date)) AS lifespan
FROM [gold.fact_sales] f
LEFT JOIN [gold.dim_customers] c
ON f.customer_key = c.customer_key
GROUP BY c.customer_key
)

SELECT 
customer_segment,
COUNT(customer_key) AS total_customers
FROM (
	SELECT
	customer_key,
	CASE WHEN lifespan >= 12 AND total_spending >5000 THEN 'Vip'
		 WHEN lifespan >= 12 AND total_spending <=5000 THEN 'Regular'
		 ELSE 'New'
	END customer_segment
	FROM customer_spending )t
GROUP BY customer_segment
ORDER BY total_customers DESC
```
📌 Key Insights
New customers (14,631) make up the largest segment, indicating a strong acquisition rate.
Regular customers (2,198) suggest a moderate level of customer retention, but many have not crossed the VIP threshold.
VIP customers (1,655) are the most valuable but also the smallest group, highlighting an opportunity for targeted retention strategies.

🔍 Key Insights from the Data

📌 Customer Segmentation:

VIP customers have a high average order value (~€2,700), indicating they are frequent and high-value buyers.

Regular customers have a lower spending trend, which suggests they need incentives to increase their purchase frequency.

New customers dominate the dataset, suggesting a strong acquisition rate but an opportunity to improve retention.

📌 Spending Trends:

Older customers (50 and above) tend to spend more per order, possibly due to higher disposable income.

Customers in the 40-49 age range form a significant portion of both VIP and Regular segments.

Avg Monthly Spend varies significantly among customer segments, which can help create personalized offers.
